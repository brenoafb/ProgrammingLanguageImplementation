# Arithmetic Expressions

This language handles integer arithmetic expressions.

## Usage

Use `stack build` to build.

`stack run` opens a repl. Type the expression and press enter to get the result.

`stack run -- -c` runs the compiled option. Upon entering an expression,
you will get the machine code and afterwards the execution result.

`stack run -- -c <filename>` will compile the program in `<filename>`
And print the machine code and execution result.
