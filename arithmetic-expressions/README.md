# Arithmetic Expressions

This language handles integer arithmetic expressions.

## Usage

Use `stack build` to build.

`stack run` opens a repl. Type the expression and press enter to get
the result.

`stack run -- -c [file]` compiles an expression into x86 code.  This
option outputs a file `output.s` and an executable `main`.

`stack run -- -v [file]` compiles an expression into a stack-based VM
byte code.  This option shows the generated bytecode and the result of
its execution.
